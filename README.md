# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- My motivation behind building this project was my desire to learn web development!
- I built this project because it serves as a record of my initial progress and enables me to help motivate other beginners to get learning! 
- It solves the problem of not having somewhere to refer to for an idea of where I am in the early stages of my learning.
- I learned how to build a basic webpage, and push and pull between my CLI and GitHub. Going forward, I'd like to learn how to make more complicated webpages with interactive elements (using JavaScript!)
